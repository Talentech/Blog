Welcome to Talentechâ€™s official technology blog. In 2019 four leading HR Tech companies, HR Manager, ReachMee, Webcruiter and Talmundo, merged to become Talentech.

On this blog we plan to share posts about technology we are working with, various challenges and how we have solved them and other topics we find useful to write about. 
 
Don't be scared to ask or comment.
