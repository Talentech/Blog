Welcome to Talentechâ€™s developer blog. In this blog we will share posts written by the developers about projects and technology we are working on and other topics we find interesting.

In 2019 four leading HR Tech companies, HR Manager, ReachMee, Webcruiter and Talmundo, merged to become Talentech. Our ambition is to be the most exiting HR Tech company to work for and we want to be great at how we can use technology to solve problems and make great tools for our customers.  

code, deploy, repeat

enjoy!
